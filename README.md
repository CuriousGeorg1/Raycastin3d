# 3D modeling

I started doing research on 3d modelling and C# and came across raycasting as a technology (old one) in game technology and decided
to play aroung with it for a bit.

## First commit

The program works as a console program and produces a picture according to the defined 2D map. When brought into .NET MAUI framework
for an inreractive UI the build fails -> theres still a lot to do.


## Lessons learned

Apparently .NET MAUI isn't the way to go, and i should try to substitute it to Avalonia


## More minor lessons

C# is actually quite a positive experience
