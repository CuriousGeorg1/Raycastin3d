# 3D modeling

I started doing research on 3d modelling and C# and came across raycasting as a technology (old one) in game technology and decided to play aroung with it for a bit.

## First commit
The program works as a console program and produces a picture according to the defined 2D map. When brought into .NET MAUI framework for an inreractive UI the build fails -> theres still a lot to do.

## Framework

Frameworkchange was a hassle for the project, especially when the goal was to keep working on the same repository. With the update the basics seem better, but a usable UI seems still to need some work.

## Lessons learned
Apparently .NET MAUI isn't the way to go, and i should try to substitute it to Avalonia

More minor lessons
C# is actually quite a positive experience
